# Drunk-Driving-Prevention-System
This project aims to use an alcohol gas sensor to measure the BAC of a driver when entering their car, warn the user about the danger that lies ahead, send a SMS message to an emergency contact alerting them of the situation, and potentially prevent the car from igniting. To implement this project, 0-3.3V ADC conversion libraries would have to be implemented so that the PIC24 can interface with the analog sensor. An LCD display could be used to display a warning message for the driver. To send a SMS message, the PIC24 could communicate with an Arduino with cellular GSM modules or the PIC24 could communicate with a Particle Photon that will activate a IFTTT recipe. The user will be asked to input number of their emergency contact using a keypad. Finally, the prevention of ignition could be simulated by connecting a button (functioning as the car key) to an LED and waiting for the user to breathe into the sensor: if the BAC is above a certain level then pressing the button will not turn the LED on, otherwise it will. This repository contains code that is used to implement a drunk driving prevention system.
